# Welcome to CodeSee Function Maps.

Have you ever tried to navigate and make sense of code in your editor only to find yourself jumping between a bunch of tabs, and losing track of: where did I see that code? how is this all connected?

CodeSee Function Maps gives you an infinite canvas where you can organize your code however you want, and easily jump from function to references to type to definition to reference!

A function map can help you:

- Ramp up on unfamiliar code
- Make sense of a complex code flow
- Plan a refactor
- Debug a tricky issue
